## Spring features

* Boot with REST
* Example of REST batch round trip with status

## REST doc features

* Swagger 2 and UI with SpringFox

## Agile features

* [CI](https://circleci.com/gh/binkley/sproingk-swagger)

## Other features

* Quieter tests and runtime (always in progress!)

## Things to think about

* Current SpringFox does not support Spring 5 (and hence, not JUnit 5)
* Logging is still to noisy during build and tests
* Get the integration tests working
* Add an end-to-end test of the running service in AWS for Circle to use
